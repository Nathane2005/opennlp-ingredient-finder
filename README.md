# OpenNLP Ingredient Finder

A sample project that demonstrates how to train an OpenNLP Named-Entity-Recognition model for a particular entity.

This example uses training data created based on the BBC Food recipe archive to try and identify ingredients.

## How to run
The sample training data and a pre-trained model is in ```src/main/resources```. There is a unit test that shows how to load the model and use it to extract named entities from an input text.
